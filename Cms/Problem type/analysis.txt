Bell polynomials, Bell polynomials of the second kind Bn,k(x1,x2,...,xn-k+1) are also called the partial Bell polynomials, where n and k are positive integers.
Complex analysis, known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers.
Functional analysis, the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure, and the linear operators acting upon these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense.
Measure theory, A measure on a set is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable subset of that set, intuitively interpreted as its size.
